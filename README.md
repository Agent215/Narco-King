# Narco-King
My attempt at my own version of the classic Dope Wars game.


I am new to coding and to java. this is a project that i figured i would start to learn more about programing. 
So far all i have done is basic GUI for the start screen. i have creted some event listeners and handlers for the buttons on the starting screen.

i also have creted a seperate JFrame for the main game. i dont know if this is the best way to move foward but i will be working on the GUI for each seperatley.
